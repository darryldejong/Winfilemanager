# WinFileManager
WinFileManager is a terminal-based script to help organize files by automatically moving them to the correct folders. This script makes it easy to keep your files organized with minimal effort.

(If you have files like document.pdf, photo.jpg, or song.mp3, the script will move them to folders such as /Documents, /Pictures, and /Music, depending on your configuration.)

## Requirements
- Python
- Colorama: pip install colorama (package is used for color-coded terminal output).

## Customization
To set your own rules for file destinations, open winfilemanager.py with visual studio code and modify the paths or file types as needed.
